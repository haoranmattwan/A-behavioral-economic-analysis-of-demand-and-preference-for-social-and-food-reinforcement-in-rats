# A behavioral economic analysis of demand and preference for social and food reinforcement in rats

This research project evaluated the relative preference for food and social reinforcers using the demand curve analysis under a behavioral economic framework.  This was published in *Learning and Motivation* in 2022.  

See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0023969021000746.  

*Note.*  The published demand curve analyses were modeled using Stata (see folder Stata) with the visualization in Prism, but one of the authors (me) forgot how to code in Stata.  A corresponding analytic code using R was included instead.  So, there might be minor differences in demand curve parameters between the R output and the ones reported in the paper.
